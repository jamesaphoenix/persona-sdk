# Persona SDK Web App

A comprehensive testing environment for the Persona SDK with Vitest, component tests, integration tests, and e2e tests with VCR cassettes.

## Features

- ðŸ§ª **Vitest Testing Suite** - Unit, integration, and e2e tests
- ðŸ“¼ **VCR Cassettes** - Record and replay OpenAI API calls
- ðŸŽ¯ **Component Testing** - Test individual SDK components
- ðŸ”„ **Integration Testing** - Test feature integration
- ðŸ¤– **AI Feature Testing** - Test AI-powered persona generation
- ðŸ“Š **Coverage Reports** - Track test coverage

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start development server
pnpm web:dev

# Run tests
pnpm web:test

# Run e2e tests
pnpm web:test:e2e

# Generate coverage report
pnpm web:test:coverage
```

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Located in `tests/unit/`
- Test individual components in isolation
- Use React Testing Library

### Integration Tests
- Located in `tests/integration/`
- Test feature interactions
- Test PersonaGroup operations

### E2E Tests
- Located in `tests/e2e/`
- Test AI features with cassettes
- Record/replay OpenAI API calls

## VCR Cassettes

The app uses VCR cassettes to record and replay API calls:

1. **Recording Mode**: Set `CASSETTE_MODE=record` and provide `OPENAI_API_KEY`
2. **Replay Mode**: Default mode, uses recorded cassettes
3. **Storage**: Cassettes are stored in `cassettes/` directory

### Recording New Cassettes

```bash
# Set environment variables
export CASSETTE_MODE=record
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...

# Run e2e tests to record
pnpm web:test:e2e
```

### Using Recorded Cassettes

```bash
# Just run tests (uses recorded cassettes)
pnpm web:test:e2e
```
